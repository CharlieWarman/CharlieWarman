        Fake news is false or misleading information presented as news. It often
        has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity, or making
        money through advertising revenue. Certain media platforms post news
        which is just propaganda to their ideals, this information is often
        untrue, biased and or cherry-picked. Propaganda hinders effective
        democratic functioning and “results in the manipulation of the mob by
        the elite.” Individuals may make decisions based off of what they hear
        in news articles, if this news is fake news then their lives may be
        negatively impacted due to them making a decision based off of false
        information. this is why it is important to us that people have a place
        to come for real, unbiased news.
