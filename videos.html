        The Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the clubs, which include
        Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool and
        Spurs, 'must answer to their fans' before launching the 'very damaging'
        change. He said the European Super League was not 'good news for fans'
        and he would work with the football authorities 'to make sure this
        doesn't go ahead in the way that it's currently being proposed'. Culture
        Secretary Oliver Dowden will make a statement in the Commons on the
        Super League plans on Monday afternoon. The rich founders of the
        proposed European Super League have today rushed to court to try to
        force through their Â£3.5billion plans financed by US banking giant JP
        Morgan despite English fans and football legends crying 'betrayal' and
        declaring war 'for the soul of football'. Mr Johnson said football clubs
        were more than 'great global brands', they needed to have a link with
        their fans and communities, with supporters already threatening to tear
        up season tickets and protest outside stadiums in huge numbers if the
        'money-grabbing' owners pursue it. Manchester United legend Gary Neville
        has laid into the club's American owners. He said: 'It's pure greed,
        they're impostors. The owners of Man United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Man
        City have nothing to do with football in this country. The fans that
        come into this ground are the people who matter. Forget them [Glazers]
        they're nothing to do with this club in terms of the actual history of
        the club and the long-term future. I would come down on them like a ton
        of bricks'. Sir Alex Ferguson, Manchester United's most successful
        manager who is still on the club's board said: 'Talk of a Super League
        is a move away from 70 years of European club football. In my time at
        United, we played in four Champions League finals and they were always
        the most special of nights.'

        Joe Biden's first overseas trip as US president will be to the UK for
        the G7 summit in Cornwall in June. That will be followed by a NATO
        summit in Brussels, as he seeks to reassert America's global leadership
        amid rising tensions with China and Russia. Both countries have
        escalated their military activity recently - China around Taiwan - and
        Russia on the border of Ukraine. Reeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at
        Ten reporting by world affairs editor John Simpson.
