      <p><b> Did Boris get it WRONG?</b></p>

      <p style="color: black">
        The ESL, also known as the European Super League, has provided much
        controversy. Boris has given messages of his involvement but what can he
        do?
      </p>
      <p style="color: black">
        One of the plans is to prevent teams from obtaining visas for their
        palyers, meaning they will not be able to travel. The Prime Minister
        Boris Johnson has said the clubs, which include Manchester United,
        Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool and Spurs, 'must answer to
        their fans' before launching the 'very damaging' change. He said the
        European Super League was not 'good news for fans' and he would work
        with the football authorities 'to make sure this doesn't go ahead in the
        way that it's currently being proposed'. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden
        will make a statement in the Commons on the Super League plans on Monday
        afternoon. The rich founders of the proposed European Super League have
        today rushed to court to try to force through their Â£3.5billion plans
        financed by US banking giant JP Morgan despite English fans and football
        legends crying 'betrayal' and declaring war 'for the soul of football'.
        Mr Johnson said football clubs were more than 'great global brands',
        they needed to have a link with their fans and communities, with
        supporters already threatening to tear up season tickets and protest
        outside stadiums in huge numbers if the 'money-grabbing' owners pursue
        it. Manchester United legend Gary Neville has laid into the club's
        American owners. He said: 'It's pure greed, they're impostors. The
        owners of Man United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Man City have nothing to do
        with football in this country. The fans that come into this ground are
        the people who matter. Forget them [Glazers] they're nothing to do with
        this club in terms of the actual history of the club and the long-term
        future. I would come down on them like a ton of bricks'. Sir Alex
        Ferguson, Manchester United's most successful manager who is still on
        the club's board said: 'Talk of a Super League is a move away from 70
        years of European club football. In my time at United, we played in four
        Champions League finals and they were always the most special of
        nights.'
